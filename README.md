# Device Repair Intake – Automation Concept

This project explores how a small repair service could organise incoming repair requests using workflow automation.

## Example Scenario
A customer submits a repair request.

Automation could:
1. Capture the request
2. Store the details
3. Notify the technician
4. Track repair status

## Why This Project
Working with device repairs made me realise how useful automation could be for organising work and reducing manual tracking.

## Learning Focus
- Workflow automation
- Process improvement
- Practical use cases
